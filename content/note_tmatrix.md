# Electron–defect $T$-matrix: diagonal $T$, self-energy & spectral function (MoS₂ V$_S$, O$_S$)

Beyond-Born electron–defect scattering for monolayer MoS₂, computed by **explicit-summation downfolding** + **Wannier interpolation** — the production path of the Anvil EDT project, ported to Kestrel and validated against it to the meV. From the same EDI matrix element $M_{n\mathbf k,m\mathbf k'}=\langle n\mathbf k|\Delta V|m\mathbf k'\rangle$ used for the [defect-DOS diagonalization](vs-defect-dos-diag.html), we resum **all orders** of multiple scattering and obtain the on-shell diagonal $T$-matrix, the defect self-energy, and the spectral function $A(k,\omega)$ along $\Gamma$–M–K–$\Gamma$.

## 1. Method — explicit-summation downfolding + Wannier interpolation

The bare $M$ over $\sim$60 bands is split into an **active** block $P$ (the 11 Wannier bands 7–17 spanning the gap region) and a **rest** block $Q$ (bands 18–70). The rest is folded into an *exact* energy-dependent self-energy on the active space (Feshbach), evaluated statically at a reference energy $\omega_0=-5.955$ eV (near the VBM):

$$\Sigma(\omega_0)=W_{PQ}\,(\omega_0-E_Q-W_{QQ})^{-1}\,W_{QP},\qquad W=M\,\mathrm{Ry}/N_{\mathbf k}$$

computed by **one** eigendecomposition of $H_{QQ}=E_Q+W_{QQ}$ (no Krylov/Sternheimer — that route stagnates at the gap). This gives the dressed 11-band potential $\tilde V = M_{PP}+N_{\mathbf k}\Sigma(\omega_0)$. The active block is then Wannier-interpolated to arbitrary $\mathbf k$ and the multiple scattering resummed exactly by a small inversion (Koster–Slater):

$$T(\mathbf k,\mathbf k;\omega)=\big[\,1-\tilde V\,G^{A}(\omega)\,\big]^{-1}\tilde V,\qquad
\Sigma_{\rm defect}(\mathbf k,\omega)=n_d\,T(\mathbf k,\mathbf k;\omega),\qquad
A(\mathbf k,\omega)=-\frac{1}{\pi}\,\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,\big[\omega-H_0(\mathbf k)-n_d T\big]^{-1}.$$

**Validation (exact vs Anvil).** The downfolded in-gap levels reproduce the independent EDT code: V$_S$ $+1.209$ eV (Anvil explicit-60 $+1.205$, DFT $+1.19$); O$_S$ $+0.730/+0.725$ eV (Anvil unrelaxed $+0.731/+0.725$ — our O$_S$ is frozen geometry). The rest-space dressing moves the *bare* 11-band level (V$_S$ $+1.484$) down to the band-converged value — the beyond-Born content this captures. **This validates Kestrel against Anvil, not against DFT** — and against the defect's own supercell DFT these in-gap *levels* over-bind: V$_S$'s $a_1$ is $\sim$0.2 eV too deep and O$_S$ has **no deep gap state at all** (the $+0.73$ is a finite-basis artifact, §4.4).

**Gauge-locked Wannier rotation.** The interpolation requires the Wannier rotation $U(\mathbf k)$ to be in the *same gauge* as the Bloch states of the $M$ matrix. An initial run used a stale `filukk` (from a separate Wannierization) whose per-$\mathbf k$ phases did not match the 90-band NSCF — the real-space $\tilde V^W$ then failed to decay (Koster–Slater truncation captured only 55 %). Re-Wannierizing on the **same 90-band NSCF** (keeping exactly bands 7–17 → 11 WF, Mo:d + S:p) restores a gauge-consistent $U$; $\tilde V^W$ now decays $\sim$2 orders over $\sim$1.5 Å and $R_{\rm cut}{=}4$ captures $\geq$99 % (§6). All results below use the gauge-locked rotation.

## 2. Diagonal $T$-matrix along $\Gamma$–M–K–$\Gamma$

On-shell $T(\mathbf k,\mathbf k;\varepsilon_{\rm top}(\mathbf k))$ for the top valence band, **with** rest-space ($\tilde V$, solid) vs **without** (bare $M$, dashed).

![V_S diagonal T-matrix](../assets/tmat_tpath_vs.png)
*MoS₂ **V$_S$**: smooth, path-symmetric $T(k)$ (a hallmark of the gauge-locked, localized $\tilde V^W$). $|T_{PP}|$ reaches $\approx0.035$ Ry; at **K** Re $T_{PP}\to0$. With-rest (solid) and bare (dashed) differ in sign of Re at K ($-0.003$ vs $+0.011$ Ry) — V$_S$ carries a **non-trivial** rest dressing.*

![O_S diagonal T-matrix](../assets/tmat_tpath_os.png)
*MoS₂ **O$_S$**: stronger scattering, $|T_{PP}|$ up to $\approx0.080$ Ry and peaking near **K**; at the K-VBM $|T|\approx0.080$ vs V$_S$ $\approx0.004$ (**$\sim$19×**). Solid$\approx$dashed — the rest dressing is **mild** for the isovalent substitution.*

## 3. Defect self-energy $n_d\Sigma_{\rm VBM}(\mathbf k)$

On-shell self-energy of the VBM band at defect density $n_d=2.78\%$ (one defect per $6\times6$ cell): **Re = level shift**, **Im = defect-limited broadening**.

![V_S self-energy](../assets/tmat_selfe_vs.png)
*V$_S$: VBM broadening $|{\rm Im}\,n_d\Sigma|$ up to $\sim$9.5 meV; the level shift Re $n_d\Sigma$ ranges $-1$ to $+13$ meV across the path.*

![O_S self-energy](../assets/tmat_selfe_os.png)
*O$_S$: broadening up to $\sim$13 meV, and a markedly larger, uniformly negative **level shift** Re $n_d\Sigma\approx-16$ to $-30$ meV — the isovalent O pushes the VBM down harder than it broadens it.*

## 4. Spectral function $A(\mathbf k,\omega)$

$A(\mathbf k,\omega)=-\frac{1}{\pi}\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,[\omega-H_0-n_d T]^{-1}$ along $\Gamma$–M–K–$\Gamma$, **with** vs **without** rest-space (log color; cyan dashed = bare $\varepsilon_{n\mathbf k}$).

![V_S spectral function](../assets/tmat_spectral_vs.png)
*V$_S$: host bands acquire a $\mathbf k$-dependent defect linewidth, plus a flat **in-gap defect resonance** ($\sim$VBM$+1.2$ eV).*

![O_S spectral function](../assets/tmat_spectral_os.png)
*O$_S$: visibly heavier band-edge smearing near K, tracking its larger $T$-matrix.*

### 4.1 Why the spectral map showed only $e$: a deep-band rest-truncation bug (and its fix)

The V$_S$ spectral map shows the deep $e$ doublet but no $a_1$ — even though DFT puts $a_1$ at $\approx+0.24$ eV as a *flat localized band* that should appear like $e$. The cause is a **basis-truncation bug in the downfolding, not an intrinsic $T$-matrix limitation**: the rest space $Q$ omitted the **deep bands 1–6**, which are exactly what bind the $a_1$.

![a1 lost without deep bands 1-6, recovered +0.24 with them](../assets/tmat_a1_deepband.png)
*$a_1$ and $e$ (rel. VBM) across treatments. $a_1$ is at $+0.24$ eV whenever the deep bands 1–6 are included (full diagonalization 1–66; downfolding with $Q\!\ni\!1$–6; DFT) and **falls below the VBM (vanishes) whenever they are excluded** (explicit 7–66; the original downfolding $Q=18$–70). The $e$ doublet sits at $\approx+1.2$ eV throughout — it needs no deep bands.*

Diagonalizing the (bra-fixed) matrix element over band ranges makes it unambiguous:

| bands | deep 1–6 | $a_1$ | $e$ |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–66 (full) | in | $+0.238$ | $+1.196$ |
| 7–66 | **out** | **gone (below VBM)** | $+1.194$ |
| 7–17 (active only) | out | $+0.005$ | $+1.484$ |

The active Wannier window is bands 7–17; the original downfolding took the rest as $Q=18$–70, **excluding 1–6**. Putting them back, $Q=\{1\text{–}6\}\cup\{18\text{–}66\}$, the downfolded static self-energy recovers $a_1=+0.238$ (self-consistent) — exactly the full diagonalization and DFT $\approx+0.24$ — while $e$ is unchanged at $+1.21$. (Feshbach downfolding is exact when $P\cup Q$ spans the full band set, so a *complete* rest must reproduce the full diagonalization; the deep bands push the occupied $a_1$ up into the gap, the high bands alone push it down — both are needed.)

So $a_1$ is a genuine gap state ($+0.24$ eV self-consistent; $+0.33$ in the static downfold). One **gauge subtlety** had to be cleared before it shows *cleanly* in $A(\mathbf k,\omega)$. The deep bands 1–6 exist only in the **bra-fixed** matrix element, whose per-$(\mathbf k,\text{band})$ phase gauge does *not* match the gauge-locked `filukk` (§6). Eigenvalues are gauge-invariant — so $a_1=+0.33$ from the diagonalization is correct — but the **Wannier interpolation is gauge-sensitive**: built directly from the bra-fixed block, $\tilde V_{\rm deep}^W$ fails to localize (on-site weight only $\sim$9 %, vs 99 % for the gauge-matched block), so the $R_{\rm cut}{=}4$ defect block is corrupt and the in-gap lines come out **jagged**. The fix needs no recompute — both active $M_{PP}$ blocks are on hand (gauge-matched from `block.py`, and bra-fixed), so the diagonal phase gauge $D$ ($M^{\rm good}=D^\dagger M^{\rm bf} D$) is recovered by phase-synchronisation (leading eigenvector of $M^{\rm good}\!\odot\!\overline{M^{\rm bf}}$; verified $\lVert D^\dagger M^{\rm bf} D - M^{\rm good}\rVert/\lVert M^{\rm good}\rVert = 1.5\%$) and applied to the rest self-energy, $\Sigma^{\rm good}_{\rm deep}=D^\dagger\Sigma^{\rm bf}_{\rm deep} D$. This restores locality (on-site $9\%\!\to\!98\%$) with $a_1/e$ unchanged. With the re-gauged, **complete** rest, $a_1$ appears in $A(\mathbf k,\omega)$ as a flat in-gap line like $e$:

![V_S spectral function, gauge-fixed deep-band rest](../assets/tmat_spectral_deep.png)
*$A(\mathbf k,\omega)$ with the **gauge-fixed** deep-band rest ($Q=\{1\text{–}6\}\cup\{18\text{–}66\}$, $\Sigma_{\rm deep}$ rotated into the `filukk` gauge), with vs without rest-space. Host bands are smooth dispersive ridges (adjacent-$\mathbf k$ $|\Delta\log_{10}A|\approx0.05$, vs the jagged pre-gauge-fix map); in the gap the **$e$ doublet** is a clear flat line at $+1.21$ eV (median $A\sim0.3$/eV) and the **$a_1$** a fainter flat line at $+0.33$ eV (median $A\sim0.15$/eV, $\sim$15× the gap-mid background) — fainter because it sits only $0.33$ eV above the VBM and is more hybridised than the deep $e$ resonance. Static $+0.33$; self-consistent / DFT $+0.24$. Both defect states are present, as in DFT.*

For contrast, the two figures below were computed with the **truncated** rest ($Q=18$–70, no deep bands) — the *symptom* of the bug, with $a_1$ pinned onto the valence-band edge ($+0.001$) and therefore invisible; they are **not** the corrected result.

![V_S defect-induced ΔA(k,ω) with the truncated rest: a1 not split off](../assets/tmat_dA_vs.png)
*(Truncated rest, no deep bands.) Defect-induced $\Delta A$: with $a_1$ mis-placed onto the band edge, the added weight (red) traces the dispersive valence band rather than forming a flat $a_1$ line. With the deep bands restored, $a_1$ moves to $+0.24$ (a clean gap level) and this pathology disappears.*

![diagonalization DOS vs truncated-rest T-matrix DOS](../assets/tmat_dos_compare.png)
*(Truncated rest.) With the deep bands omitted, $a_1$ sits on the valence edge and gives no DOS peak (continuum $\Delta\rho\approx0.01$ near the VBM), while $e$ ($+1.21$) gives a clean peak. With $Q\ni1$–6 the $a_1$ returns as a $+0.24$-eV gap feature.*

**Corrections to earlier versions of this note.** Three intermediate claims/figures here were wrong and are retracted: (i) a large "$a_1$ DOS peak" from an earlier $\mathbf k$-path-sum (a valence van-Hove artifact); (ii) the attribution of the missing $a_1$ to a "band-edge under-binding that needs DFT self-consistency" — the true cause is the deep-band (1–6) truncation of the rest, fixed **inside** the $T$-matrix by including those bands in $Q$, no DFT self-consistency required; and (iii) a first deep-rest spectral map with **jagged** in-gap lines — an artifact of building the deep block from the bra-fixed matrix element, whose gauge does not match `filukk`; re-gauging $\Sigma_{\rm deep}$ (above) gives the smooth map shown. ($e$, the deep empty state, was correct throughout.)

**The same complete-rest correction, applied to O$_S$ — opposite sign.** Running the identical corrected pipeline for the isovalent O$_S$ substitution (complete rest $Q=\{1\text{–}6\}\cup\{18\text{–}66\}$; $\Sigma_{\rm deep}$ phase-synced into the `filukk` gauge — verified $1.4\%$, on-site locality $99.4\%$) shows the deep bands matter here too, but *oppositely*. With them in $Q$, $P\cup Q$ spans the full 1–66 set, so the Feshbach downfold is **exact** (= full diagonalization): the in-gap structure is then a single degenerate **doublet at $+0.735$ eV** ($\approx+0.73$, matching Anvil — but itself an EDI finite-basis artifact: supercell DFT has **no** deep O$_S$ gap state, §4.4). The truncated rest ($Q=18$–66) instead produced a *spurious* extra level at $+1.564$ eV near the CBM. This is the **mirror of the V$_S$ pathology**: an incomplete rest *lost* a real state there ($a_1$), and *invents* one here. The doublet stays degenerate (no direct-mode C$_3$ splitting), and the map is smooth (adjacent-$\mathbf k$ $|\Delta\log_{10}A|\approx0.03$):

![O_S spectral function, gauge-fixed deep-band rest](../assets/tmat_spectral_os_deep.png)
*O$_S$ $A(\mathbf k,\omega)$ with the gauge-fixed **complete** rest. The only in-gap feature is the flat **doublet at $+0.735$ eV** (median $A\sim0.3$/eV); the truncated-rest's $+1.564$ eV level has vanished to background ($A\sim0.01$/eV) — it was a rest-truncation artifact, not a defect state. Band-edge smearing near K is markedly heavier than V$_S$, tracking O$_S$'s $\sim$19× larger $T$ at the VBM.*

### 4.2 Why the spectral function uses the resummed Dyson form, not $G_0+G_0TG_0$

The spectral function above uses the **resummed** Green's function $G=[\omega-H_0-n_dT]^{-1}$, not the single-defect, linear-in-$T$ form $G=G_0+G_0TG_0$. The two are the same to $\mathcal O(n_d)$ — expanding $[G_0^{-1}-n_dT]^{-1}=G_0+n_dG_0TG_0+\mathcal O(n_d^2)$ — but only the resummed form gives a physical ($A\geq0$) spectral function at finite concentration: at a host band $G_0\sim1/(\omega-\varepsilon)$, so the linear correction carries a double pole $1/(\omega-\varepsilon)^2$ whose dispersive imaginary part drives $A$ **negative**, whereas the resummation turns it into a finite Lorentzian (the band acquires width $\mathrm{Im}\,\Sigma=n_d\mathrm{Im}\,T$ instead of diverging).

Computing both from the *same* band-space $T(\mathbf k,\omega)$ confirms this — and pins down *when* it matters:

![resummed vs linear spectral function](../assets/tmat_alinear.png)
*MoS$_2$ V$_S$. Left/middle: $A_{\rm res}$ and $A_{\rm lin}$ maps at the physical $n_d=2.78\%$ — **indistinguishable** (both $\geq0$). Right: a line cut at K as $n_d$ is raised — the linear $A_{\rm lin}$ dips **negative** (unphysical) more and more, while the resummed $A_{\rm res}$ stays positive.*

| $n_d$ | $A_{\rm res}$ min | $A_{\rm lin}$ min | $A_{\rm lin}$ negative fraction |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.78% (physical) | $+0.03$ | $+0.03$ | 0.0% |
| 10% | $+0.04$ | $-6.5$ | 1.4% |
| 30% | $+0.04$ | $-33.5$ | 4.7% |
| 50% | $+0.04$ | $-64.4$ | 6.4% |

So at the dilute physical concentration the linear and resummed spectral functions **agree** (the resummation is a negligible $\mathcal O(n_d^2)$ correction); the linear form's negative-$A$ pathology only sets in at high $n_d$, where resummation is mandatory. The resummed form is used throughout precisely so the result stays physical at any $n_d$.

### 4.3 Matrix-element sanity check: O$_S$ vs V$_S$ along $\Gamma$–M–K–$\Gamma$

A direct test that the new O pseudopotential enters the EDI matrix element cleanly: fix the initial state at the band edge $K$ and trace $|M(K\,n_i;\,\mathbf{k}_f\,n_f)|$ as $\mathbf{k}_f$ runs along $\Gamma$–M–K–$\Gamma$, for the first valence (VB1) and first conduction (CB1) bands.

![O_S vs V_S matrix element along the k-path](../assets/tmat_mkpath_vs_os.png)
*$|M(K,\mathbf{k}_f)|$ for V$_S$ (left) and O$_S$ (right), $\mathbf{k}_i=K$ fixed (the VBM/CBM band edge), for VB1–VB1, CB1–CB1, and VB1–CB1. The two are **structurally identical** — every feature coincides: the symmetry-forced VB1–VB1 zero at $\Gamma$, the forward-scattering peak at the $K$ diagonal ($\mathbf{k}_f=\mathbf{k}_i$), and the VB1–CB1 nodes — and differ only in overall scale (V$_S\approx3\times$O$_S$), as expected from the vacancy being a stronger perturbation than the isovalent O$\to$S substitution. Fixing the band edge $K$ rather than $\Gamma$ avoids the $\Gamma$-point band degeneracy and probes the physically relevant band-edge coupling. The new-pseudopotential matrix element carries **no defect-specific artifact**: it tracks the validated V$_S$ case exactly.*

The **nonlocal** part of $M$ (the O- vs S-projector term) separately equals the difference of single-atom *isolated* O and S Kleinman–Bylander projectors placed at the defect site, $\langle\psi_{m\mathbf{k}_i}|V_{NL}^{O}-V_{NL}^{S}|\psi_{n\mathbf{k}_f}\rangle$, to $4\times10^{-7}$ Ry over the **full** $M_{nl}$ matrix — band-diagonal *and* off-diagonal ($m\neq n$), $\mathbf{k}_i=\mathbf{k}_f$ *and* $\mathbf{k}_i\neq\mathbf{k}_f$. The supercell subtraction $m_{nl,d}-m_{nl,p}$ thus correctly isolates the atomic O$-$S difference; the off-diagonal additionally validates the $Y_{lm}$ cross terms and the structure-factor phase of the defect site. Together with the local-potential sum rule ($T+V_{\rm loc}+V_{NL}=\varepsilon$, to $\mu$eV) and the null-defect check ($V_d=V_p\Rightarrow M=0$ to machine precision), the O$_S$ matrix element is fully validated.

### 4.4 Benchmark against supercell DFT: the deep in-gap levels are EDI finite-basis artifacts

> **⚠ Substantially revised by §4.5.** A later full recompute with **SG15 ONCV pseudopotentials** ($E_{\rm cut}=75$ Ry) shows the dramatic over-binding documented in this section — O$_S$'s $+0.73$ and V$_S$'s $a_1=+0.33$ — was largely an artifact of the **old pseudopotential set**, *not* the finite-basis projection. With SG15 the EDI in-gap levels closely match DFT. The mechanism below (a localized level bound in the truncated basis) is real, but its magnitude was inflated by the old pseudopotentials.

§4.3 confirms the matrix element $M$ is correct. The in-gap *levels*, however — obtained by diagonalizing $H=\mathrm{diag}(\varepsilon)+M\,\mathrm{Ry}/N_{\mathbf k}$ in the **pristine primitive Bloch basis** — do **not** match the defect's own supercell DFT. They over-bind, and O$_S$'s "$+0.73$" is spurious.

**Supercell DFT (ground truth)** — frozen-geometry, $\Gamma$-only, same pseudopotentials/$E_{\rm cut}$:

| in-gap level | O$_S$ | V$_S$ $a_1$ | V$_S$ $e$ |
|---|---|---|---|
| DFT $6\times6$ (2.78 %) | **none** | $+0.112$ | $+1.171$ |
| DFT $12\times12$ (0.69 %, dilute) | **none** ($E_g{=}1.651\approx$ pristine) | $+0.116$ | $+1.177$ |
| EDI ($=$ Anvil) | **$+0.73$** | $\sim\!+0.33$ | $+1.21$ |

O$_S$ is isovalent (O, S both 6 valence e⁻); DFT at both 2.78 % and the 4× more dilute 0.69 % gives **no deep gap state** (clean $\approx\!1.66$ eV gap), so the EDI's $+0.73$ has no DFT counterpart. For V$_S$ the EDI over-binds the deep, localized $a_1$ by $\sim\!0.2$ eV while the shallower $e$ agrees — the over-binding scales with depth/localization, and O$_S$ (no real deep state) is its extreme.

**What the $+0.73$ is — unfolding to primitive $\mathbf k$.** Resolving each state into primitive crystal momentum, $A(\mathbf k)=\sum_b|c_{\mathbf k b}|^2$ (participation ratio $\mathrm{PR}_k=1/\!\sum_k A(\mathbf k)^2$; $\mathrm{PR}_k{=}1$ a single band-$\mathbf k$/host-like, $\to N_{\mathbf k}{=}36$ a real-space-localized state):

| state | $\mathrm{PR}_k$ | character |
|---|---|---|
| DFT O$_S$ LUMO | $2.3$ | host CBM at **K** (94 % the pristine CBM) |
| EDI $+0.73$ eigenvector | **$33.2$** | **real-space localized** — near-uniform over all 36 $\mathbf k$ |

The real O$_S$ band-edge states are **host-like** — the LUMO is the slightly-perturbed pristine CBM at K (confirmed independently by a pristine-supercell ↔ defect-supercell overlap: $U$ near-unitary, defect LUMO $94$ % the pristine CBM, $\mathrm{PR}\!\approx\!1$). The EDI's $+0.73$ is the opposite: spread near-uniformly across the **entire** BZ, i.e. **real-space localized** — a level the deep O potential binds inside the *truncated* primitive basis but that the exact self-consistent DFT does not have.

**Mechanism.** $H=\mathrm{diag}(\varepsilon)+M$ is the defect Hamiltonian $H_0+\Delta V$ projected onto a *finite* set of pristine primitive Bloch states (a variational/Feshbach projection). For a deep, spatially sharp perturbation this projection over-binds — manufacturing a localized in-gap level as a loose variational upper bound — whereas DFT, in the defect's own self-consistent eigenbasis, has none. So the in-gap *levels* above, though reproduced code-to-code by Anvil, are a property of the **EDI's finite pristine-basis projection**, not the real defect: V$_S$'s $a_1$ is over-bound and O$_S$ has **no deep gap state**. (The matrix element §4.3 and the off-shell band-edge scattering it drives are correct; it is specifically the *bound in-gap pole* — hence the in-gap resonance in $A(\mathbf k,\omega)$ — that the finite-basis projection over-binds.)

### 4.5 SG15 recompute: the over-binding was largely a pseudopotential artifact

> **⚠️ Attribution corrected in §4.6.** The *data* below is right (SG15 @ $E_{\rm cut}=75$ Ry has no O$_S$ $+0.73$), but the cause is **not** the pseudopotential: switching dojo→SG15 also switched $E_{\rm cut}$ (100→75). A controlled $E_{\rm cut}$/grid study (§4.6) shows the $+0.73$ is an **$E_{\rm cut}$-window artifact** — present only at $E_{\rm cut}\approx$ 90–100 Ry, and independent of pseudopotential, band count, and grid.

Re-running the **entire pipeline** (primitive SCF/NSCF, supercell SCFs, $\Delta V$ cubes, edmat, diagonalization) with **SG15 ONCV norm-conserving pseudopotentials** at $E_{\rm cut}=75$ Ry — same frozen geometry, same $6\times6$ $k$-grid, 70 primitive bands — overturns most of §4.4. The band structure is unchanged (VBM/CBM/gap identical to $10^{-3}$ eV), but the EDI in-gap levels move into close agreement with the supercell DFT:

![DFT vs EDI 70-band DOS, SG15](../assets/dos_dft_edi70_sg15.png)
*DOS (states/eV per $6\times6$ cell), SG15 / $E_{\rm cut}=75$ Ry: supercell DFT ($\Gamma$, gray) vs the EDI Hamiltonian $\mathrm{diag}(\varepsilon)+M$ diagonalized over **70 primitive bands** (red), both aligned at the bulk VBM (black dotted; blue dotted = bulk CBM). **V$_S$** (left): the occupied $a_1$ now sits at the DFT position; the empty $e$ doublet is $\sim$0.2 eV too high. **O$_S$** (right): the old spurious mid-gap $+0.73$ doublet is **gone** — the gap is clean, the only in-gap feature is a conduction-edge state ($\sim$+1.37 vs DFT LUMO $\sim$+1.6).*

| in-gap level | old EDI (ecut 100) | **SG15 EDI (ecut 75)** | supercell DFT (SG15) |
|---|---|---|---|
| V$_S$ $a_1$ | $+0.33$ | **$+0.130$** | $+0.136$ ✓ |
| V$_S$ $e$ | $+1.21$ | $+1.37$–$1.42$ | $\sim\!+1.2$ |
| O$_S$ deep | **$+0.73$** | **none** (edges: $+0.089$, $+1.37$) | none |

So the dramatic $+0.73$ (and the V$_S$ $a_1$ over-binding) was **largely a property of the old pseudopotential set** (and/or the higher $E_{\rm cut}$), not an intrinsic finite-basis limitation: with clean SG15 pseudopotentials the EDI reproduces DFT to $\sim$5 meV for the V$_S$ $a_1$ and correctly gives **no deep O$_S$ level**. A small residual ($\sim$0.2 eV) remains in the empty conduction-edge states — the genuine, much smaller finite-basis effect. (The §4.4 unfolding/rotation analyses were run on the *old-pseudopotential* edmat; the mechanism they identify is real but its scale was set by those pseudopotentials. 66- vs 70-band diagonalization shifts the SG15 levels by $<5$ meV — band-converged.)

**Full T-matrix path (SG15).** Running the complete EDT production path on the SG15 edmat — re-Wannierize ($\to$ `filukk_sg15`, 11 WF from bands 7–17), deep-band downfold ($Q=\{1\text{–}6\}\cup\{18\text{–}70\}$, exact static $\Sigma$), Koster–Slater resummation on a $24\times24$ BZ grid — gives the defect-concentration ($n_d=2.78\%$) spectral DOS:

![SG15 T-matrix DOS](../assets/tmat_dos_sg15.png)
*SG15 T-matrix DOS. Left ($\rho$): host (dashed) vs defect-dressed. Right: defect-induced $\Delta\rho$. **V$_S$** (top): $\Delta\rho$ peaks at the $a_1$ ($\sim+0.17$) and the $e$/CBM-edge ($\sim+1.4$). **O$_S$** (bottom): $\Delta\rho$ is **flat across the mid-gap (0.3–1.2 eV) — no deep state** — only band-edge redistribution. The resummed T-matrix DOS reproduces the direct-diagonalization / DFT picture: no spurious O$_S$ $+0.73$, V$_S$ $a_1$ near the VBM.*

Two SG15 simplifications vs the §4.1 gauge gymnastics: (i) the deep bands 1–6 live in the *same* edmat (band range 1–70) and gauge as the active block, so no separate bra-fixed matrix element is needed; (ii) the SG15 re-Wannierization passes its NSCF-interpolation check directly ($<10^{-4}$ eV), so no $\Sigma_{\rm deep}$ re-gauging is required — both because the edmat and `filukk_sg15` derive from one self-consistent NSCF.

**Spectral function along Γ–M–K–Γ.** The same SG15 12×12 downfolded block (deep-band rest; reference energy $\omega_0=$ VBM) gives the resummed spectral function $A(\mathbf k,\omega)=-\frac1\pi\,\mathrm{Im\,Tr}\,[\omega-H_0-n_dT]^{-1}$:

![SG15 spectral function](../assets/spectral_sg15.png)
*$A(\mathbf k,\omega)$ along Γ–M–K–Γ (SG15, 12×12 $k$-grid, $\omega_0=$VBM, $n_d=2.78\%$), energy referenced to the VBM. **V$_S$** (left): host bands plus two flat in-gap resonances — the $a_1$ ($\sim$+0.1) and the $e$ ($\sim$+1.44). **O$_S$** (right): host bands with band-edge redistribution only — the mid-gap (around $+0.7$, where the *old* pseudopotentials placed the spurious level) is **clean, no deep state**. k-converged (6×6 ↔ 12×12) and robust to the reference energy ($\omega_0=-5.955$ ↔ VBM shifts the levels $<5$ meV).*

Direct diagonalization, T-matrix DOS, and the spectral function — all three SG15 routes agree: **no deep O$_S$ level; V$_S$'s $a_1$ sits just above the VBM** — matching DFT.

### 4.6 The $+0.73$ is an $E_{\rm cut}$-window artifact, not pseudopotential, grid, or band count

A controlled factorial study — holding the EDI-required commensurate grid (supercell FFT $=6\times$ primitive) fixed while sweeping $E_{\rm cut}$, then holding $E_{\rm cut}$ fixed while changing the grid — pins the origin of the spurious O$_S$ deep level.

**Ground truth (DFT supercell, $E_{\rm cut}$-converged).** The $\Gamma$ eigenvalues of the 108-atom O$_S$ supercell are *identical* at $E_{\rm cut}=$ 75, 100, 120 Ry. O$_S$ is isovalent (O, S both group VI), so it binds **no deep gap state**: the only in-gap feature is a CBM-derived $e$-doublet at **$+1.625$ eV above VBM ($0.035$ eV below the CBM)** — the host-CBM-like LUMO of §4.4.

![O_S defect DOS vs ecut](../assets/dos_ecut_os.png)
*EDI direct-diagonalization defect DOS $\mathrm{diag}(\varepsilon)+M\cdot\mathrm{Ry}/N_k$ for O$_S$ at $E_{\rm cut}=$ 75/100/120 Ry (all commensurate grids) vs the DFT supercell (black dashed = truth). Left: full spectrum (grey = host VB/CB). Right: gap zoom. The spurious isolated mid-gap peak at **$+0.73$ eV appears only in the $E_{\rm cut}\approx$ 90–100 window**; at 75 and 120 Ry the defect doublet stays near the CBM (gap otherwise empty), matching DFT ($+1.625$, magenta).*

So the famous $+0.73$ (and the Anvil EDT $+0.725$, computed at $E_{\rm cut}=100$) is a **numerical artifact of the EDI explicit summation in a narrow $E_{\rm cut}$ window**, correlated with an anomalous high-band matrix-element norm: $\lVert M\rVert_{[27\text{–}70]}=911$ eV at $E_{\rm cut}=100$ vs $\sim$347 at 75/120 Ry, while the low-band $\lVert M\rVert_{[1\text{–}26]}$ stays smooth ($\sim$600).

| ruled-out cause | test | result |
|---|---|---|
| pseudopotential | SG15 vs dojo at same $E_{\rm cut}$ | identical (eig $M$ corr 0.99) |
| band count | dojo 66 vs 70 bands | identical (no deep at $E_{\rm cut}$ 75) |
| grid commensurability | force super $=6\times$prim at $E_{\rm cut}$ 75 | same as natural grid$^\dagger$ |
| grid resolution | grid 40 vs 48 at $E_{\rm cut}$ 100 | identical ($+0.728$) |

$^\dagger$The local-potential fold in `ed_coarse.f90` (≈ line 2225) maps the supercell $\Delta V$ onto the primitive grid by a pure `MOD` index map (no interpolation), so it *does* require $n^{\rm super}_{\rm FFT}=(\text{size})\times n^{\rm prim}_{\rm FFT}$ — a genuine gotcha — but every run here satisfied it exactly (verified in the cube headers and the `edi.x` log; `good_fft_dimension`$=n$, no padding, on this Kestrel build). The nonlocal part (`get_betavkb`) is built analytically in primitive $G$-space and needs no commensurability.

**Takeaway.** The EDI explicit-summation level for an isovalent, CBM-resonant defect is *not* $E_{\rm cut}$-robust — it can spuriously bind a mid-gap state in a particular $E_{\rm cut}$ window. The DFT supercell is the reference; EDI in-gap levels must be cross-checked against it and tested for $E_{\rm cut}$ sensitivity. (V$_S$ has genuine vacancy-derived deep states, but the same caution applies to their exact positions.)

## 5. $T(nk,\omega)$ spectral map

The full energy dependence of the VBM-band diagonal $T(nk,\omega)$ along $\Gamma$–M–K–$\Gamma$ — **Re** (level shift) and **Im** ($-$Im $\propto$ scattering rate) as separate maps; dashed = on-shell $\varepsilon_{\rm VBM}(k)$.

![V_S T(k,omega) map](../assets/tmat_map_vs.png)
*V$_S$: a **dispersionless (flat-in-$k$) in-gap resonance** at $\omega\approx-4.9$ eV — Re $T$ shows the level-shift sign flip across it, Im $T$ a bright scattering ridge. Flatness in $k$ is the signature of a localized defect state (and a direct check that the gauge-locked interpolation is clean).*

![O_S T(k,omega) map](../assets/tmat_map_os.png)
*O$_S$: in-gap structure that is stronger near **K** and carries an additional branch toward the CBM, consistent with the larger O$_S$ $T$-matrix.*

## 6. Real-space locality & gauge validation

The Wannier interpolation and the $R_{\rm cut}$ truncation are only valid if the dressed potential $\tilde V^W(\mathbf R)$ is localized. With the gauge-locked `filukk` it is:

![real-space decay & Koster-Slater truncation](../assets/tmat_decay_locality.png)
*On-site $\|\tilde V^W(\mathbf R,\mathbf R)\|$ decays $\sim$370× (V$_S$) / 160× (O$_S$) over $\lesssim$5 Å (envelope $\lambda\approx1.5$/3.0 Å); the Koster–Slater truncation captures $\geq$99 % already at $R_{\rm cut}{=}0$ and 100 % by $R_{\rm cut}{=}2$ — so $R_{\rm cut}{=}4$ is amply converged.*

![electron-index gauge check](../assets/tmat_decay_gauge.png)
*Gauge diagnostic: the electron-index decay $\|M^W(R_e;q)\|$ now falls for **every** $q$ (48–79× over $\sim$5 Å). A per-$\mathbf k$ gauge mismatch would leave $q\neq0$ flat (the failure mode of the initial stale `filukk`, where $R_{\rm cut}{=}4$ captured only 55 %). All-$q$ decay confirms $U(\mathbf k)$ and $M$ share one smooth gauge.*

## 7. Summary

| Quantity | V$_S$ (vacancy) | O$_S$ (substitution) |
|---|---|---|
| Downfolded in-gap level (vs Anvil) | $+1.21$ eV ✓ ($+1.205$) | $+0.73$ eV ✓ ($+0.731$) |
| **vs supercell DFT (§4.4)** | $e$ agrees; **$a_1$ over-bound** ($+0.33$ vs DFT $+0.116$; $E_{\rm cut}$-dependent, →$+0.13$ at 75 Ry) | **spurious** ($E_{\rm cut}$-window artifact, §4.6) — DFT has **no deep state** |
| $\|T_{PP}\|$ at K (VBM) | $\approx0.004$ Ry | $\approx0.080$ Ry (**$\sim$19×**) |
| $\|T_{PP}\|$ max on path | $\approx0.035$ Ry | $\approx0.080$ Ry |
| VBM broadening $\|{\rm Im}\,n_d\Sigma\|$ max ($n_d=2.78\%$) | $\sim$9.5 meV | $\sim$13 meV |
| VBM level shift Re $n_d\Sigma$ | $-1$ to $+13$ meV | $-16$ to $-30$ meV |
| Rest-space dressing | non-trivial | mild |

**Headline:** at the valence-band edge (K) the isovalent **O$_S$ scatters $\sim$19× harder than the V$_S$ vacancy** and shifts the VBM down markedly more, while the **rest-space dressing matters more for V$_S$** — the beyond-Born physics the explicit-summation $T$-matrix resolves. All quantities use the gauge-locked Wannier rotation (validated by the §6 real-space decay). **Caveat (§4.4–4.5):** with the *old* pseudopotentials the EDI in-gap *levels* over-bound (O$_S$ a spurious $+0.73$, V$_S$ $a_1=+0.33$ vs DFT). An **SG15 recompute (§4.5) shows this was largely a pseudopotential artifact** — the clean SG15 EDI matches DFT (V$_S$ $a_1$ to $\sim$5 meV; no deep O$_S$ level), leaving only a $\sim$0.2 eV residual in the empty states. The matrix element and band-edge scattering are unaffected throughout. Pipeline and matrix elements are in place to repeat this for WS₂ V$_S$/O$_S$.
